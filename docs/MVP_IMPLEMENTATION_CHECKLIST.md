- **SSL**: Traefik + Let's Encrypt (auto-renewed certificates).
- **Storage**: MinIO self-hosted S3 for backups; local Docker volumes for media.
- **Media serving**: Fixed production media serving via Django `serve` view.

### Previous Updates (v1.1.0)
- **State Management**: Migrated from Context API to **Jotai** for atomic state updates (Cart, User, UI).
- **Frontend Stack**: Upgraded to React 19, Vite 6, and Tailwind CSS 4.
- **UI Refresh**: Modernized Admin Dashboard and general UI aesthetics.

### Future Improvements
